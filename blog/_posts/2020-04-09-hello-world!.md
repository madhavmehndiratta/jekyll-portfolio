Welcome to 0xm1m3, my new blog! By the title of this post, I'm positive you're assuming this will be some kind of programming language tutorial, but stay with me. This right here, is in fact my very first post in this blog! And no, it's not a boring programming tuts blog for newbies - no worries!

Thanks for dropping by! Make sure to stay tuned for upcoming InfoSec and other Tech related posts. Moreover, I will be posting about matters and issues concerning the Information Security segment, as well as my personal experiences in the Cyber Security world.

Furthermore, I will be sharing with you guys some of my own challenge walkthroughs, code, exploits and much more. Stay Tuned!

### Goals: 

- Document what I learn.
- Share knowledge that might help others.
