    <p align="justify">Dorking is a technique that is used by investigative organisations, security auditors as well as tech savvy criminals to query various search engines for information hidden on public websites and vulnerabilities exposed by public servers. I've made a dork scanner using python that searches Google or Bing in order to find possible vulnerable URLs.</p>

    <p align="justify">Steganography is the method of hiding secret data inside any form of digital media. The main idea behind steganography is to hide the existence of a data in any medium like audio, video, image etc. Based on this concept, I have made a python script that hides text inside a given image using LSB Technique.</p>
